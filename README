Notes for version 1.03
  Fixed a bug in the subSF function (numbers ending in zero were
  getting them truncated).


In many scientific applications, it is often useful to be able to format
numbers with a given number of significant figures, or to do math in
such a way as to maintain the correct number of significant figures.
The rules for significant figures are too complicated to be handled solely
using the sprintf function (unless you happen to be Randal Schwartz :-).

These routines allow you to correctly handle significant figures.

They can count the number of significan figures, format a number to a
given number of significant figures, and do basic arithmetic.
